# Applied-Data-Science-with-Python


###### About This Specialization (taken from Coursera description)

The 5 courses in this University of Michigan specialization introduce learners to data science through the python programming language. This skills-based specialization is intended for learners who have a basic python or programming background, and want to apply statistical, machine learning, information visualization, text analysis, and social network analysis techniques through popular python toolkits such as pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, nltk, and networkx to gain insight into their data.


###### Modules Used:

- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Nltk
- Networkx
- Gensim (LdaModel)
- Scipy.stats (ttest_ind)



## Introduction to Data Science in Python


###### About This Course (taken from Coursera description):

This course will introduce the learner to the basics of the python programming environment, including fundamental python programming techniques such as lambdas, reading and manipulating csv files, and the numpy library. The course will introduce data manipulation and cleaning techniques using the popular python pandas data science library and introduce the abstraction of the Series and DataFrame as the central data structures for data analysis, along with tutorials on how to use functions such as groupby, merge, and pivot tables effectively. By the end of this course, students will be able to take tabular data, clean it, manipulate it, and run basic inferential statistical analyses.


###### a1.py

Introduction to Pandas dataframe, and answer basic statistical questions about data from 'olympics.csv' and 'census.csv'.


###### a2.py
